# env-prompt
A dependency-free utility that prompts you for your project's environment variables.

## How does it work?
On `npm install`, env-prompt reads environment variables from files in your project:
 - a **distributed** file (default: **`.env.dist`**)
 - a git ignored **local** file (default: **`.env`**)

Envprompt will diff these two files, prompting you for any values that exist in your distributed file but not in your
 local file.  Your newly input values will be written to your local environment file.

## Getting started
1) Install env-prompt:
```sh
$ npm install -D env-prompt
```

2) Add a postinstall hook to your `package.json`:
```diff
{
  "name": "test",
  "main": "index.js",
+ "scripts": {
+   "postinstall": "env-prompt"
+ },
  "devDependencies": {
    "env-prompt": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

3) Create a `.env.dist` file in the same directory as your `package.json`:
```
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=root123
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=sakila
```

Env-prompt is now configured.  On `npm install`, you will now be prompted for any new values in your `.env.dist`
 file that don't exist in `.env`.

## Options
```sh
-d, --distFile <path>         
       Change the distributed environment file env-prompt reads from. (default: .env.dist)

-l, --localFile <path>
       Change the local environment file env-prompt reads from and writes to. (default: .env)
```
